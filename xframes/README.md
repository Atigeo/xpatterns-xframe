XFrame Library
==============

Setup
-----

The python library is here, and in the subdirectories.  You should make sure this directory is in your PYTHONPATH, or else copy this directory into your PYTHONPATH.

You need to set and export SPARK_HOME to point to your spark installation.  The library will automatically add the spark libraries to your python path.
