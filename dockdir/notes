HDFS Docker
-----
$ dockdir=$XFRAMES_HOME/dockdir
$ docker run -dt -p 8020:8020 -p 50070:50070 -p 50075:50075 -v "$XFRAMES_HOME/dockdir":/opt/xframes --hostname xpatterns-hadoop xpatterns/hadoop
Runs a docker where hdfs server is on 8020.

Returned urls to the datanodes will have the internal hostname xpatterns-hadoop.
Map this to 127.0.0.1 in the hosts file.

Use docker exec to get an interactive shell.
Then use scp to copy files in, and hdfs dfs commands to write them into hdfs.

$ docker ps
Lists the running dockers.  Look for the id.  ex: 8d1...

$ docker exec 8d1 ls
List the files in the docker local file system.

$ docker exec -it 8d1 /bin/bash
Get an interactive shell in the docker.


$ docker run arg: -v "$dockdir":/opt/iad
Don't know what this does.


From within the docker, manipulate hdfs by "hdfs dfs" command.

root@xpatterns-hadoop:/# hdfs dfs -ls /
root@xpatterns-hadoop:/# hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/cch
root@xpatterns-hadoop:/# hdfs dfs -ls /user
